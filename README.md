# Dancing-Robot
This OpenGL Mini Project showcases that graphics provides one of the most natural means of communicating with a computer, since our highly developed 2D pattern-recognition abilities allow us to perceive and process pictorial data rapidly and efficiently. We are using the OpenGL library to implement the project. OpenGL has a lot of inbuilt functions which makes the drawing of any geometric objects quite easy. This project aims at creating 3D Dancing robot. With the help of GLUquadriObj we create spherical and cylindrical structure and with the help of other basic OpenGL function like glRotatef, glTranslatef we assemble the objects into 3D robot. Four different light sources are created at different locations and are triggered randomly to give a better look to the dance. Along with the above, the sound is implemented in the same program using the windows libraries.
